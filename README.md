# Osman-Bot

Osman is the instagram bot that get users who not following back you.

I used Selenium. Very thanks to Selenium for these advantages.
Also I wrote the codes compatible with Google Chrome ! 

*Using cmd to use that program is recommended !!*

Requirements:
    -Python 3.x
    -Selenium
    -Google Chrome

To install selenium package --> pip install selenium

Do not forget to change 'instaUserInfo.py' document !!
You have to write your username and password there...

Then you can run 'Osman.py'

When program started, after short time all processes will be done !

After browser closed, check the 'Osman-Bot-master' folder !

'followings.txt', 'followers.txt' and 'notFollowingBacks.txt' will be created in same folder !

For the people who not following you back, you can check the 'notFollowingBacks.txt' :)

*If program could not do anything at first try, try again ! Sometimes it does not work according to your internet connection or the reasons that I could not understand.*
